========= Tips: ===========
#-----------------------------------------------{
# - How create ".list" file ?
	#   ".list" file works similar to "task" package. It means that task installs suggested packages for desktop environment,
	#    but ".list" file have also added some dependencies, because apt doesn't remove some of them,
	#    Removing all dependencies can broke system, so ".list" file keeps only part - not important dependencies.
	#    ".list" files should be sorted, in list folder exists script which can help.

	# Comand shows which packages are needed for task-kde4 metapackage
	apt-cache depends task-kde4    
	apt-cache depends task-kde4    | cut -d" " -f4 

	# Command shows which packages use AfterStep metapackage
	apt-cache whatdepends AfterStep
#-----------------------------------------------}

# How to list all installed Desktop Enviroments:
	ls /etc/X11/dm/Sessions/
	grep -h "Name=" /etc/X11/dm/Sessions/* | cut -c 6-

# Other:
	$ echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
	MATE

	$ echo $DESKTOP_SESSION
	05MATE

	$ ps -e | grep 'mate-session'
	6876 ?        00:00:00 mate-session

	$ cat /etc/sysconfig/desktop
	DISPLAYMANAGER=GNOME

	$ cat $HOME/.dmrc
	[Desktop]
	Session=05MATE

# - script "create.pot.and.po.files" help create ".po" files
# - script "sort.sh" help sort files, because should be sorted.
